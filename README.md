# NICEmissingPeople
A python based twitter search to help catalogue a database of missing people in Nice in France in the aftermath of the terror attack. There is a twitter account which is accepting tweets from people with photographs about their missing loved ones. Lets make a simple web page and host it online which will capture the live twitter feed and list them in a searchable webpage.
